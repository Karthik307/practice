    <h3>1. What is Destructuring?</h3>
    Destructing is a process of extracting the exact elements from an array which are required to,
    for example if we have a array called cpu[items]=['motherboard','processor','GPU','display ports', 'disk ports',
    'SSD', 'HDD'].
    When we use the regular method of extracting the elements from array we had to aceess all the elements presnt but,
    in destructuring we can access the elements which are actually reuqired for us. we can actually just take the
    reuiqred components of cpu array to make the desired result.<br>
    <pre>
        Example: const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];
                 const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;
    Here we can extract exactly what we want if we feel that truck and SUV isn' required we can replace them by empty 
    values which gives us only car as result.

    const [car,,]=vehicles;
    </pre>

    <h3>2. What can we destructure?</h3>
    <p>We can use destruture for arrays, objects and maps</p>

    <!-- 3.Spread or Rest Operator -->
    <h3>3.Spread or Rest Operator</h3>
    <p>Spread is used to collect elemts from different arrays and place them in a singe array or objet.</p>
    <pre>ex: const a1=[1,2,3] and const a2=[4,5,6]</pre>
    <p>Here we can use spread operator to combine both to make a singe array and spread operator is identified by 3 dots
        (...).</p>
    <pre>Now to combine we have to write the code as 
        const a=[...a1, ...a2];
        console.log(a);
    </pre> <br>
    <p>On the other hand rest operator is little opposite it is only used for function arguments in destructuring, it
        allows a function to collect infinite number of arguments</p>
    <pre>
        ex: const a,b, ...c;
            [a,b]=[1,2];
            if we print a will be 1 and b will be 2.
            if other elements are added we can simply use rest operator with 3 dots and use it to assign them to it, we can also call the elements of rest using index value.
                ex: [a,b,...c]=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
                <p>here a=1 and b =2 so remaing are stored by rest operator using array and index values.</p>
                if we print console.log(c) the output will be 3,4,5,6.
                if we use c(n) it will give element present in specific index value.
    </pre>
